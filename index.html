            <h2>How I think about engineering leadership</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="about__text">
            <p>
              I’ve spent most of my career working inside engineering organisations —
              building teams, scaling platforms, and delivering under real constraints.
              What that taught me is that leadership failures rarely come from lack of
              intelligence or effort. They come from unclear expectations, poor
              incentives, and systems that reward the wrong behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
              I care deeply about technical credibility, not because leaders need to be
              the best engineers in the room, but because trust is built when decisions
              are grounded in reality. I’ve seen what happens when leadership drifts too
              far from the work — delivery suffers, people disengage, and the same
              problems repeat under different names.
            </p>
            <p>
              Much of my focus today is on supporting women in engineering as they move
              into leadership roles. Not by teaching them to be louder or more
              confident, but by helping them navigate power, visibility, and
              decision-making without compromising their values or their technical
              judgement.
            </p>

            <h3>Supporting engineers as they step into leadership</h3>
            <p>
              Many of the people I work with are excellent engineers who suddenly find
              themselves leading others. I help them make sense of that transition,
              build authority in a way that feels authentic, and stay connected to the
              work without trying to do everything themselves.

            <h3>Being heard in senior decision-making forums</h3>
            <p>
              I work with women who are doing solid work but aren’t always heard in
              senior rooms. We focus on how decisions are framed, when to speak, and
              how to communicate in ways that carry weight — without performing
              confidence or becoming someone they’re not.

          <article class="expertise-card">
            <h3>Delivering consistently without burning people out</h3>
            <p>
              I’ve seen too many teams rely on goodwill, heroics, and late nights to
              keep things moving. I focus on creating ways of working that are
              predictable and sustainable, where delivery doesn’t depend on who is
              willing to sacrifice the most.

          <article class="expertise-card">
            <h3>Working with product without losing engineering judgement</h3>
            <p>
              Working closely with product and design matters, but it only works when
              roles and expectations are clear. I help engineering teams stay engaged
              in product decisions while protecting technical judgement and long-term
              health.
